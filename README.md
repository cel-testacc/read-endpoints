# read-endpoints
This is a repository made to integrate multiple API endpoints from multiple sources into one aggregate endpoint.

This is an ongoing project. 
To emulate each source endpoint, I used a separate language and/or framework.
All the aggregated endpoints will be sourced to a nodejs/fastify web server, which will then join the data into a final result endpoint. 
The goal is to expand the projects and add multiple languages/frameworks that are easily swappable for testing purposes.
