## This is one of the endpoints written using Go (which I am still learning) and the Gin framework.

### Dependencies:
- "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
- "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"

Starting the server displays a GET response of the mid-level listing of book titles (the second endpoint in this project).

Attached is a dummy/test mysql file for testing purposes.

#### TODO: unit test for this
